## 🏆 JUDGE Q&A PREPARATION

**Q: "How is this different from existing platforms?"**
A: "We focus on accessibility with AI guidance, anonymous reporting, and a dedicated investigator interface - existing platforms often lack one of these."

**Q: "Is it secure?"**
A: "Yes - we support anonymous reporting, validate all inputs, restrict file types, and in production would use encrypted databases and HTTPS."

**Q: "Can it scale?"**
A: "Absolutely. The modular architecture makes it easy to add authentication, backend APIs, real-time notifications, and databases."

**Q: "Why not use a chatbot for everything?"**
A: "We provide both options - chatbot for those who prefer conversation, and a traditional form for those who want direct input. Flexibility is key."

**Q: "How long would production deployment take?"**
A: "With a backend developer, 2-3 weeks for MVP with authentication, database, and basic analytics. The frontend is production-ready."
